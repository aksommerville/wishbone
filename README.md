# When You Wish Upon A Bone

Requires [Egg v2](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg2) to build.

For [One Week, One World Jam](https://itch.io/jam/one-week-one-world), theme "ONE TOOL, MANY USES".

Zelda-style adventure where Dot has just one item: A wishbone.

She'll use it many ways:
 - Stab. (natural A)
 - Swing. (rotate dpad, A). Bats items away.
 - Pole Vault. (hold dpad, A). Skip 1m or so aerially.
 - Boomerang. (double-tap dpad, A). Like Zelda.
 - Wand. (hold A, dpad to encode). Like Full Moon.
 - Slingshot. (hold A, release with nothing encoded). Pick a direction and magnitude continuously, then fly, and the wishbone stays where it was.
 - Lockpick. (natural A facing context). Minigame where you press plungers from opposite sides. Align to open the lock.
 - Maybe other context-sensitive uses?

Track usage of each technique, and send educators at appropriate moments if it hasn't been used much.
Or maybe just keep the educators static, that's less to think about.
