16 Picking locks is easy, if you have some two-pronged tool.
17 Tap forward twice then immediately use the wishbone, to perform a pole vault!
18 Double-tap to throw your wishbone. With the right spin, you can make it return! It's all in the wrist.
19 Stand still and hold the button to cast a spell. Try "ULDURD" to put out these fires.
20 You can use your wishbone as a slingshot! Just make like you're casting a spell, but don't cast one.
21 Return here with a wishbone and I will teach you in its ways.
